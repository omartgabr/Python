# Web Scraping HTML Data

This project uses web scraping techniques to extract the City College of New York academic year calendar. The calendar is extracted from the City College of New York website in HTML format and is then parsed and organized into a more usable format.

Some of the modules used in this project include:
* **requests** for making HTTP requests
* **BeautifulSoup** for parsing and manipulating HTML
* **IPython** for interactive development and testing

This project serves as a way to extract data from HTML websites, specifically the City College of New York calendar, and can be easily adapted for use with other websites.
